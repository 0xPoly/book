===========

v0.1.1
======

First update; no separate public release, just updated on the web
site. Many small grammar fixes, spelling fixes, and generic sentence
cleanups contributed to the overall quality of the book.

Progress is being made towards multiple formats (particularly EPUB), a
fully automated build system (a Makefile is already present and mostly
working) and nicer graphics.

v0.1.0
======

First public release!
